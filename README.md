# 🧠 NineSamples

Welcome to the official sample repository for **Nine Ether Blockchain** `.nine` smart contract files and Web4 games.

This repo is home to working examples built using the **.nine syntax** — a lightweight language for building games, UI, and smart contracts that run natively on the **Nine Ether Chain**.
